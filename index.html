        <p>At OBMC, we are deeply committed to the philosophy and educational method developed by Dr. Maria Montessori. The Montessori education emphasizes independence, freedom with responsibility, and respect for the child’s intellectual, spiritual, and social development. Children learn through exploration, manipulation, order, repetition, abstraction, and communication.</p>

Montessori Center) offers comprehensive Montessori education from preschool (Casa) through Senior High School, focusing on holistic development with strong academics, arts (music, theater, dance, visual arts), sports, and outdoor programs like scouting, all within nurturing, purpose-built environments to foster independence, creativity, and leadership.
